			<h2>Cyberpunk 2077 Cut This Gameplay Feature, But For A Good Reason</h2>
			<h1>CD Projekt Red says the feature was removed for "design reasons."</h1>
			<aside>

			</aside>
			<p>Game development is an iterative process. Features are often added and removed regularly during the development process as the team discovers what works best. For <strong>Cyberpunk 2077</strong>, developer CD Projekt Red worked on a wall-running feature, but it won't make it into the final game. In a new interview, one of the game's designers explained why the feature was cut.</p>

			<p>Level designer Max Pears told GameReactor that while wall-running has been cut for design reasons, the game will offer players "a lot of flexibility" with how they move through the world.</p>

			<p>"Ah, the wall-running" Pears said. "That is something that we removed due to design reasons, but there's still going to be a lot of flexibility in how you move, that's for sure."</p>

			<p>GameSpot recently played four hours of Cyberpunk 2077, and you can head directly from GameSpot's Edmond Tran, Jake Dekker, and Tamoor Hussain about it in the video above. You can also check out GameSpot's own interview with Max Pears here.</p>

			<p>Cyberpunk 2077 will release for Xbox One, PS4, and PC on November 19. Next-gen upgrades will also be available for free.</p>

			<h2>This Minecraft Texture Pack Might Be One Of the Most Detailed Ever</h2>
			<h1>A Minecraft texture pack currently in development called Not Another Photorealistic Pack shows off some of the most stunning visuals ever in the game.</h1>
			<aside>

			</aside>
			<p>A new Minecraft texture pack adds some of the most detailed assets ever to out of the game’s mod scene. Nearly a decade after its release, Minecraft continues to be a massively popular game with a huge following on streaming sites and more than 100 million monthly users as of September 2019.</p>
			<p>Given that Minecraft is built around the idea of players creating their own worlds, it may be no surprise that the game still has an active modding scene to this day. It’s possible for enterprising players to add entirely new content to the game, like delivery drones and the ability to build a working desktop computer. Minecraft by default is a simple looking game, and while that’s fine for many players, others have decided to improve that as well, making Minecraft visual upgrade mods some of the most popular for the game.</p>
			<p>Currently in development, Not Another Photorealistic Pack (NAPP) takes that popular idea and runs with it, creating new assets that it’s hard to believe are actually in Minecraft. In a recent video, YouTuber FernFox compared the textures in the current version of NAPP to the default graphics in Minecraft to show just how wild of a transformation the mod pulls off. The mod’s developer, who goes by del_cieno on Reddit, has also shared up-close views of the renders for various objects and posts frequent updates to the project. While it’s in development, NAPP is available only to Patreon subscribers.</p>
			<p>While modders have been hard at work pushing what’s possible in Minecraft, Mojang has also been keeping up with new content for the nearly decade-old game. On the graphics front, Minecraft now supports ray tracing, which could enable better default visuals for Minecraft on Xbox One and even more impressive options for modders. Minecraft has also been receiving a stream of content updates to add new locations, materials, and other features to the game. Recent updates have added new biomes to the Nether, new block types like honey, and a cool respawn anchor feature that could be a game changer for dungeon divers.</p>
			<p>Minecraft has certainly fallen from its peak of popularity when it seemed like the most talked about game in the world, but it really hasn’t gone anywhere. It may not get discussed as much today, but Minecraft still has legions of loyal fans, and the attention from new additions to the franchise like Minecraft Dungeons may even bring lapsed players back, or introduce new ones to it for the first time.</p>
